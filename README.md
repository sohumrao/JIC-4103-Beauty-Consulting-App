# Beauty Consulting App
This product is a mobile app for beauty consultations. The current product is a client profile creation interface, allowing for users to input personal information as well as specific hair details/concerns. This was chosen as the artifact to be implemented because from the beginning, the goal of this project has been to bridge the gap between beauty client and stylist; allowing users to upload details to be seen by stylists will alleviate concerns on both ends and make the consultation process easier overall. This artifact also allows for a demonstration of the full technology stack, since data can be inputted         through the UI, sent to the back end, and uploaded to the database.
